Projects from MISIS :
As part of the Golang courses at NUST MISIS University, students studied the basics of the Go programming language,
including memory management, competitiveness, and garbage collection. 
The applications developed during the course use this knowledge to create a solution capable of processing large amounts of data with high speed and efficiency.
